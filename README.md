# User Maintenance

A high level library and REST API for user management using REDIS as the storage engine released under the GPLv3 licence written in the GO
language whicgh has excellent support out of the box for servers and a good set of cryptograhic libraries.

This library and service was originally writen for a web site for managing various software settings on an IOT device running on an ARM v7 proccesor with Ubuntu Linux as the underlying operating system. I only wanted authorised users to have access so I needed a way of allowing them to login to the system in a secure manner and manage other users as well as reset passwords and change email addresses.

I did not want to re-invent the wheel when it came to storage and I had the option of using either SqlLite or Redis for the data storage 
and went with Redis due to its rich types, linux support, and speed and the  ability to set a Time to Live (TTL) on the data. The actual passwords are stored securely as 32-byte base-64 encoded hash values derived using the PBKDF2 algorithm.
